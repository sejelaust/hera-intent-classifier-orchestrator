Clarifying questions
##API contract

 - Should persona_id be optional or required? What does it change (prompt, routing, model selection)? Answer: persona_id is required. It doesn't change anything, but is used for tracking.
 - What is the intended format of history? Raw string, array of {role, content} messages, or structured turns? Answer: array of {role, content} messages. Just like regular Open AI conversation history.
 - Is user_id required or optional? Any downstream usage (telemetry, personalization)? Answer: user_id is required. It doesn't change anything, but is used for tracking.
 - Are we enforcing strict validation (reject unknown fields, require all fields), or permissive with defaults? Answer: strict validation.
 - Output fields: You list both multi_intents and single_intent. Do we need both, or should there be a single list and a boolean flag indicating single vs multi? Answer: the output has been updated. In the "classification_details" the classifcation should only be shown, if the classifer actually made a match".


##Golden path filtering

 - What is the authoritative set of allowed values for golden_path? Should they match keys in configs/intents.json only, or also cover split-intents main IDs and response-intent IDs? answer: They should match keys in all of the three configs.
 - Should we reject the request if any golden_path ID is unknown, or silently ignore unknown IDs? answer: Silently ignore
 - Do you want the filter to remove entire main split intents if the main ID is not in golden_path, or to filter by sub-intents as well? answer: Only by main ID

##IDs and mapping consistency

 - intents.json uses keys like identifyPatient, askQuestion924. split-intents.json uses main IDs like ID_NAME_DOB: Please state your name and date of birth. and sub IDs like ID_NAME_DOB_sub-intent_1. How should we map golden_path items to split-intent main IDs? Do you have/need a mapping file? Answer: The ID in split-intents.json has been updated and the IDs now match. 

##Classifiers

 - Multi-intents classifier: Should it read from intents.json only? The task doc currently says it reads split-intents.json (likely a typo). Answer: only read from intents.json
 - Response-intents classifier: Which config should it use? There’s no intent-responses.json in configs/. Please confirm file name, structure, and placement. Answer: Its called intent-responses.json. Same format as intents.json
 - Patient-education classifier: Which config file should it use? There’s no config for it in configs/. Should it also derive from intents.json or a new file? - Leave this one out for now
 - For each classifier, do you want structured outputs including reason, classified boolean, and IDs? Should the reason be per matched ID or a single overall reason? I want structured outputs and the reason should be overall per classifier

##Split-intent matcher

 - Confirm the rule: We add a main split intent to “newly matched” only if all its sub-intents are present in the union of newly classified sub-intents and prev_classified_sub_intents, and at least one sub-intent was newly matched in this run. Correct? Answer: correct. 
 - Should the API return an updated prev_classified_sub_intents for the client to persist, or do we persist server-side? Answer: It should return an updated version called "classified_sub_intents" 

##Aggregation and output schema

 - Please define the exact shape for split_intents_recognized. Proposed: an object keyed by main intent ID with { sub_intents: [...], newly_completed_main: boolean, reason?: string }. Is this acceptable? Answer: {
    “intents_classified”: <list of all new intent IDs recognized>,
    "classified_sub_intents": # Used for client to send back in “prev_classified_sub_intents”
        {
            “<main intent ID with matched sub intents>“: <list of sub intent IDs previously matched>,
            “<main intent ID 2 with matched sub intents>“: <list of sub intent IDs previously matched>
        },
    "classification_details": {
        “split_intents_classified”: 
            {
                “sub_intents”: "<list of classified sub-intents>
                “reason”: "<classifier reason>"
            }

        “multi_intents”: {
            "intents": "<list of matched intent IDs>",
            "reasion": "<classifer reason>"
        },
        “single_intent”:  {
            "intents": "<list of matched intent IDs>",
            "reasion": "<classifer reason>"
        },
        “response_intents”:  {
            "intents": "<list of matched intent IDs>",
            "reasion": "<classifer reason>"
        }
    }
}
 - For all_intents_recognized, should it include: multi-intents recognized, individual intents from intents.json, newly completed main split intents (as main IDs), response intents, and patient-education intents? Or a deduplicated union with category labels? Answer: remove duplicates.
 - Should we include confidence scores per classifier/category? Answer: No


##LLM integration choices

You ask to use LangChain and PydanticAI “together.” Do you want PydanticAI Agents/Run orchestration, or simply Pydantic models for LangChain’s structured outputs? Combining both is possible but atypical—please specify the desired pattern.
Are we standardizing on Azure OpenAI function/tool calling for structured output, or LangChain’s with_structured_output?

##Tracing and observability

Should we trace every classifier run and the orchestrator with LangSmith? Do you have project name/environment variables defined?
Any logging/PII constraints for prompt and user inputs?

##Infrastructure/performance

Max parallel classifiers per request? Any timeout budget for the entire request?
Rate limits and backoff/retry behavior for Azure OpenAI?

##Versioning

Pydantic v2? Specific versions for LangChain, LangSmith, OpenAI SDK? Are we okay pinning versions in pyproject.toml?

##Housekeeping

Confirm that the legacy configs/dual-intents.json is deprecated and not needed.
Confirm we should move TASKS.md only under Tasks/ and remove the root one (currently deleted in git status).


#Suggested changes and additions

##Normalize IDs and config structure

Make main IDs in split-intents.json pure IDs (no appended prompt) and include a separate prompt field if needed:
Example main item: { "id": "ID_NAME_DOB", "prompt": "Please state your name and date of birth.", "sub_intents": { "ID_NAME_DOB_sub-intent_1": [...], ... } }
Provide an explicit mapping between golden_path items (e.g., identifyPatient) and split-intents main IDs (e.g., ID_NAME_DOB) if they differ.

##Fill missing task specs

Complete Tasks/classifier_response-intents.md and Tasks/classifier_patient-education.md analogous to the other classifier specs: inputs, config sources, expected structured outputs, examples.

##Add missing configs

Add configs/intent-responses.json (or confirm another name) and any new config for patient education if it’s separate from intents.json. Define their schemas up front.

##Fix typos/inconsistencies

In Tasks/classifier_multi-intents.md, change “filtered configs/split-intents.json” to “filtered configs/intents.json”.
In Tasks/TASKS.md, fix smart quotes and the malformed API input keys (e.g., missing colon after persona_id, truncated askQuesti).
Standardize on ASCII quotes in all examples.
“Pydanic AI” → “PydanticAI”.

##Define strict request/response models

Request: explicitly define types and validation rules for history, golden_path, and prev_recognized_sub_intents.
Response: finalize shapes for split_intents_recognized, multi_intents, response_intents, patient_education, all_intents_recognized, and whether to include confidences and reasons per item.

##Golden path filter behavior

Decide whether to error on unknown IDs vs ignore, and whether filtering applies to split-intents (by main ID), intents, and response-intents.

##Orchestrator design

Have each classifier return a typed Pydantic model { classified: bool, ids: [...], reason(s): ... }.
Use asyncio to run them concurrently with shared request context and filtered configs.
Implement a deterministic merger with category tags and de-duplication rules.

##Split-intent matcher contract

Return both: updated prev_recognized_sub_intents and newly_completed_main_intents.
Clarify precedence if conflicts occur (e.g., partial overlaps or contradictory outputs).

##LLM setup alignment

Convert src/llm_setup.py into a reusable factory that returns a LangChain ChatOpenAI (Azure) instance configured from env vars; remove top-level example call and print.
Configure structured output either via LangChain or Azure function calling; if using PydanticAI for schema control, define where it sits in the chain.

##Tooling and packaging

Add pyproject.toml for UV with pinned versions (FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic v2, LangChain, LangSmith, OpenAI SDK azure, tiktoken).
Add .env support and document required env vars: AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT, AZURE_OPENAI_KEY, AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION, AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT, LANGSMITH_API_KEY, LANGSMITH_PROJECT.

##Testing and examples

Provide a minimal test suite and example payloads for each classifier and the API endpoint, including golden-path filtering and split-intent matching edge cases.
Add a /health endpoint.

##Security/governance

Redact PII in logs/traces, add input size limits, and define retry/backoff on API calls.
If you confirm the answers to the questions above (especially around IDs/mappings, missing configs, and the final response schema), I can draft the finalized schemas and the initial project scaffolding next.
